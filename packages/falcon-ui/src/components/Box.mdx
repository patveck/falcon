`Box` is a simple, generic component that by default renders as `div`.
It doesn't ship with default theme, but yet still accepts accepts all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props).
It's very flexible and can be used to quickly prototype new components or create one off components with custom needs.
